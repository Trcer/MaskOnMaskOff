                <p>Brought to you by the same people who vaped in the bathroom stall, stole the soap dispensers,  
                    graffitied the walls, and cook and ate the cafeteria goldfish, comes now another uniquely useless act of "Whatever  
                    am I doing with my life?". Yes, we know this is stupid. But what other alternative is there  
                    when you're stuck in a mental institution dubbed sir winston churchill for 7 hours a day for 3 years?  
                    P.S: Thanks to the guy with the e-boy haircut  
                    in class for giving me this idea. Lunch on you for the next week cuz im broke from buying this
                     site, also shoutout to claire for dumping me for that jock cuz of this shit. fuck you bitch. Also P.P.S: I literally
                      made this on a thursday afternoon 
                    at nose hill library with at least 3 unit exams coming up, which I didn't study for- honestly are  
                    we even surpised at this point- and a part time job i had to rush to(so i was having a little bit of a crisis) so talk to me if something doesnt work. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. Sending my love and wishing you all a lovely school year xoxo <br/>
